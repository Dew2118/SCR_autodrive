Situations where just changing following_speed to new one and call follow_signal_restriction:
work:
	1.next aspect: yellow, following_speed: > 45, under_signal_restriction: doesn't matter  reason: keep following_speed as speed_limit
	2.next aspect: red, following_speed: doesn't matter, under_signal_restriction: False  reason: following_speed saved as speed_limit
	
doesn't work:
	3.next aspect: yellow,following_speed: <=45 (assuming it's 0), under_signal_restriction: red  reason: overwritten to 45 
	4.next aspect: red, following_speed: doesn't matter(assuming it's 0), under_signal_restriction: red  reason:overwritten to 0
	5.next aspect: red, following_speed: doesn't matter (assuming it's 45), under_signal_restriction: yellow  reason:overwritten to 0
	6,next aspect: other, following_speed: doesn't matter (assuming being under_signal_restriction), under_signal_restriction: doesn't matter reason:overwritten to speed_limit
	
fixes:
	1.set both following_speed and speed_limit work for: 1,2,3 (because when it goes back to under_signal_restriction = False then it'll pull from speed_limit), 4 (because when it goes back to under_signal_restriction = False then it'll pull from speed_limit),5 (because when it goes back to under_signal_restriction = False then it'll pull from speed_limit), 6
	2.
